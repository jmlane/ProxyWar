Execution

<br/>
Securing this territory its population for our side is the ultimate goal.
The method is to diminish the enemy's ability to fight, either by constraining their mobility, suppressing their maneuver, or destroying their assets.
Special operations forces should be utilized to find the enemy and coordinate with high command to fix and fight them.
All conventional assets, air, artillery, mines, mortars, and more should all be considered as tools SOF can coordinate in the fight.

Situation
<br/>
<br/>
Enemy Forces:
<br/>
Our enemy is a battalion size combined arms force.
The enemy force includes numerous light trucks, light, medium, and heavy armored vehicles, and may include embedded special operations forces.
The enemy will attempt to seize and hold various centers of population and production.
Our worst case scenario is if the enemy destroys our critical weapons systems or otherwise impedes our ability to effectively fight them.
<br/>
<br/>
Friendly Forces:
<br/>
We are attached to a combined arms battalion, consisting of three combined arms companies and a headquarters company.
The ultimate mission is to subdue the major enemy forces operating in this area.
Each combined arms company consists of three platoons and a weapons section.
The headquarters company contains attached artillery and air defense artillery, as well as special troops and support troops.
The three platoons of each line company are light dragoons, medium dragoons, and heavy cavalry.
The weapons section is comprised of two squads of infantry, one equipped with anti-air missile systems, the other equipped with mortars.
Light dragoon platoons include three squads of infantry dismounts riding into battle in fast armored personnel carriers.
Medium dragoon platoons include three squads of infantry dismounts riding into battle in tough armored fighting vehicles.
Heavy cavalry platoons include two sections of two heavily armored, powerful tanks.
<br/>
<br/>
Attached/Detached Elements:
<br/>
We are attached to this combined force to enhance their capabilities in any way practical.
We may be ferried about the battlefield as needed by attached air assets.
They take several minutes to arrive on station, consider calling in advance.
No elements are detached.
<br/>
<br/>
Civil Considerations:
<br/>
Harming civilians will lose local support, and will lose this war.
Check your targets.
