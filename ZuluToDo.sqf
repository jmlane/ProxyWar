/*A list of things to do.
Urgent:

Priority:
- Player ferry system.
- "Functionalize" the reinforcement script.

Routine:
- Implement air support modules.
- Make command assignments repeatable.
- Tidy mission folder.

Convenience:
- Casualty recovery?
- Each critical casualty or death costs their side one ticket.
- Every casualty, corpse, or wreck that is recovered and returned to their home base restores (a) lost ticket(s) to their side.
- Make command assignments slot agnostic.
- Morale system? Per AI element, casualties, combat, and movement diminish morale.
- Morale is recovered slowly when units are still and "safe".
- If morale is too low, AI elements break contact.
- Type diary entries for in game use.
- Players may join custom channels.
- Players get static effect when recieving messages from too far away.
- Players with backpack radios have less static.
- Player personnel jacket and stats (time in service, rank, qualifications, et.)
- Retransmission stations can reduce static.
- Players with terminals may transmit text messages?
- Rewrite scripts to reduce redundancy.
- High commanders must be within 'range' to give orders.
- "Immersify" player ferry system.
- "Immersify" player respawn/redeployment.
- "Immersify" AI respawn/redeploy.
- "Immersify" AI respawn/redeploy.
- Work in headless clients.
